# XNET: Deep Learning Based System for Radiologist.


For every radiologist to use this project i have created a web-application with simple interface so that everyone can understand and use it for their purpose.
this web-application can detect Various diseases like Covid-19, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis from Lungs X-Ray as well as CT-Scan Images by using deep learning and convolutional neural network.



# Dataset used:


1. Chest X-Ray (Pneumonia,Covid-19,Tuberculosis). => (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis)
2. Large COVID-19 CT scan slice dataset. => (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maedemaftouni/large-covid19-ct-slice-dataset)
